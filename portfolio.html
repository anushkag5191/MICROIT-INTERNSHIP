    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>Hello! I’m Anushka Gupta, a third-year B.Tech Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) student at Banasthali Vidyapith with a passion for technology, logic, and purposeful innovation. I enjoy solving complex problems and developing intelligent systems that make a real-world impact.<br>
<br>From a young age, I aspired to become a fighter pilot—drawn to the discipline, courage, and sense of service it demands. While life steered me toward technology, my keen interest in defense remains a core part of who I am. Today, I aim to contribute to this field through the lens of computer science—exploring how AI, robotics, and cybersecurity can strengthen national defense and strategic capabilities.
<br>Academically, I have a strong foundation in Java, Data Structures, and AI, and I’m always eager to explore emerging technologies. I’ve worked on projects that reflect both my technical skills and creativity.
Beyond the classroom, I’ve represented my district in basketball, participated in athletics, and enjoy solving Sudoku puzzles—activities that keep me sharp, disciplined, and resilient.
<br><br>Growing up in a home where both my parents are Chartered Accountants, I’ve always valued structure, integrity, and continuous learning. These values guide both my academic and personal growth.
This portfolio reflects my journey, skills, and aspirations—combining my love for technology with a deep-rooted interest in defense and national service.</p>
